# Overview

In some situations, it can be necessary to deploy files/folders directly to user desktops. For example, run-only `.exe` files (like TeamViewer QS) may need to be deployed or informational PDFs/documents may need to be sent out.

To achieve this with Intune, we package the files/folder and a PowerShell script into a Win32 application and deploy it as normal.

# The Process

To see an example of this done with TeamViewer QS check [here](https://github.com/contrxl/Intune/tree/main/App%20Gallery/TeamViewer%20Quick%20Support). You will need to download `install.cmd` and `PSscript.ps1` from that link to follow these steps. To modify the script to work with whatever files/folders are being deployed, change the following values:

- `$Folder` : change this to the exact name of the file or folder you are deploying.
- `$Destination` : change this to the directory you wish the files/folder to be deployed to, by default this is the public desktop.

<br />Now, make sure that the `PSscript.ps1`, `install.cmd`, and the files/folder you wish to deploy are all stored in the same folder. Use the Win32 Content Prep tool to package the file into the `.intunewin` format. Upload this as you would with a normal Win32 application. The detection rules will need to be configured to match your deployment, select "**Manually configure detection rule**" and use the following:

- **Rule Type**: File
- **Path**: Set this to match the `$Destination` variable in `PSscript.ps1`
- **File or Folder**: Set this to the name of the file or folder, e.g. "File1"
- **Detection Method**: Set this to file/folder exists
- **Associated with 32-bit app on 64-bit clients**: No
